#Portfolio Project : https://portfolio-gules-seven-16.vercel.app/

- Read through Angular documentation: https://next.angular.dev
- Install Angular globally, switch my nodejs version and created the portfolio project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBt031nQPu0
  *npm install -g @angular/cli
  *npm use 20.15.0
  *ng new portfolio-app
  *ng serve
  *ng s -o
- Next step was to create components which were to be built
  *ng g c components/navbar
  *ng g c pages/home
- Next of was to ensure routing accross the different pages set-up with the previous step, I realised that tha app.routes.ts is very import here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3f0KTdNyA

!!SKIPPED FOR 11 DAYS, FIGHTING THE STRONGEST BUGS, I'VE FACED SINCE GENESISðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, Angular 18 is a WOW, OMG QUINUELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!
- Ensured proper routing of the 4 portions of the screen view, Also installed Bootstrap and added it to the package.json file
  *npm install bootstrap

- Today, I fixed the routing properly for the layout and pages component. Biggest lesson learnt was ensuring to follow same normenclature of files while adding to the app.modules.ts and app.routes files, also cleaning and rebuilding helps too
  *ng clean
  *ng build
- So basically each component created is provided in a folder contain 4 files endiing with the following extensions: .html, .css, .ts, spec.ts
- Basic HTML and CSS on the respective pages plus Bootstrap which wasn't verify successful
- Header, Footer, Navbar and Home done

  - Finally done with the porfolio website, I learnt a lot along the way about Angular, and improved my typescript by 0.01 (very large progress in my perspective fr)
  - I faced some difficulties with responsiveness and routing again but this time , through correction from my supervisor Ms. Nasah, I learnt the .ts file shouldn't be altered for the different contents
  - Also, the way I set up the components weren't best, didn't follow the documentation as I intended due to () but I was able to correct some aspects before hoisting on vercel
  - The portfolio is my very first work using Angular, and with all the flaws on it, I think I outdid my nervous curious self a little bit. Definitely improve in the EMS
  - I did pretty good with documenting hay, I wasn't very consistent as I thought I would but ..., so ..... and .... hahahaha
  - Rating my self a genuine **4/10**
